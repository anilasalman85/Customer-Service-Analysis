### **Overview**

This project is a complete machine learning solution designed to help companies better understand customer feedback. It predicts how satisfied a customer might be (CSAT score) and identifies the overall sentiment of their reviewâ€”whether it's positive, negative, or neutral. A clean and interactive web interface allows users to view results in real time.



### **Problem**

Businesses receive countless reviews and feedback every day, but manually analyzing each one is time-consuming and inconsistent. Without a quick and accurate system, it's difficult to track overall satisfaction and spot common issues in customer service.



### **Proposed Solution**

We created a machine learning tool that automatically processes customer reviews to predict satisfaction levels and detect the mood behind the feedback. Users can enter text into a simple web form, and the system returns predictions along with helpful visual summaries.



### **Key Features**

- **Smart Preprocessing**: Automatically handles missing values, cleans the review text, and prepares it for model input.
- **Sentiment Classification**: Breaks down each review as either Positive, Negative, or Neutral using language patterns.
- **CSAT Estimation**: Uses review text to forecast how satisfied the customer likely felt.
- **Performance Reporting**: Includes metrics like precision, recall, and F1 score along with a confusion matrix.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The React frontend allows anyone to use the system easily and view results instantly.
- **Real-Time Results**: Input a review, get feedback predictions immediatelyâ€”no waiting.
